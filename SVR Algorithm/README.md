# Support Vector Regression (SVR) Projects

This repository contains three small projects implementing Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms in Python. Each project includes the dataset used and demonstrates different aspects of SVR for regression tasks.

## Projects Overview
1. Project 1: Basic SVR  
   - Simple regression example with one feature.  
   - Focus on understanding SVR fundamentals.

2. Project 2: Intermediate SVR  
   - Multiple features, parameter tuning, and model evaluation.  

3. Project 3: Advanced SVR  
   - Feature scaling, kernel tricks, and performance optimization.  

## Datasets
All datasets used in the projects are included for easy reference and practice.
