# Support Vector Classification (SVC) Projects

This repository contains several projects implementing Support Vector Classification (SVC) algorithms in Python. Each project comes with the dataset used and demonstrates different levels of complexity and SVC techniques.

## Projects Overview
1. Project 1: Basic SVC  
   - Simple classification example with one dataset.  
   - Focuses on understanding SVC fundamentals.

2. Project 2: Intermediate SVC  
   - Multiple features, parameter tuning, and performance evaluation.  

3. Project 3: Advanced SVC  
   - Feature engineering, kernel tricks, and model optimization.  

*Add more projects as needed with a brief description of each.*

## Datasets
All datasets used in the projects are included in the repository for easy reference and practice.
